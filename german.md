# 6-Month German Plan: Complete Beginner → B2 (Zero Budget Edition)

## Real Talk First

You're starting from **absolute zero** with **zero money**. This changes everything, but it's still doable. You'll work harder than people who pay for tutors, but thousands have done this before you. Let's build this properly for YOUR situation.

## What is Anki? (Start Here)

**Anki** is a free flashcard app that shows you words right before you forget them. It's the single most important tool you'll use.

**How to set it up (Do this TODAY)**:
1. Go to ankiweb.net on your computer
2. Download Anki for Windows/Mac/Linux (100% free)
3. Create a free AnkiWeb account (for syncing)
4. Inside Anki, click "Get Shared Decks" at the bottom
5. Search for **"German Sentences from Tatoeba"** or **"5000 German Sentences Sorted"**
6. Download it (one click, it's free)

**What's a "deck"?** It's just a collection of flashcards someone already made. Instead of making 5,000 flashcards yourself, you download theirs.

**Your daily Anki routine**:
- Week 1: 5 new cards per day (takes 5 minutes)
- Week 2: 10 new cards per day (takes 10 minutes)
- Week 3+: 15-20 new cards per day (takes 15-20 minutes)
- Always review ALL cards Anki shows you (this is the magic part)

Don't worry about understanding this perfectly now. Download it, click around, you'll figure it out in 10 minutes.

## The Brutal Honesty Section

**This is HARD without money**:
- No professional tutor to correct your speaking mistakes immediately
- No structured courses guiding you
- You'll make more mistakes and fix them slower
- Your speaking will lag behind paid learners

**But you WILL succeed if**:
- You do this EVERY SINGLE DAY for 182 days
- You aggressively seek free corrections (Reddit, language exchange)
- You use language exchange calls as your "free tutoring"
- You're comfortable being bad at German for months

**The advantage you have**:
- You're motivated (job depends on it)
- You have internet access
- You have 6 months
- Thousands of free resources exist

## Final Thoughts

You said you're "super broke" but you have a computer and internet. That's enough. Every resource I listed is free or "findable" online.

The 500-word essays and 10-min monologues? You're right - you CAN'T do them now. That's why I scheduled them for Month 2-3, when you CAN do them.

Start small: 2 minutes of speaking Week 3. Then 5 minutes Month 2. Then 10 minutes Month 3. You'll grow into it.

**Your job for today**: Download Anki. That's it. Just do that one thing.

Tomorrow: Do 5 Anki cards and watch one German video.

Small steps every day = B2 in 6 months.

Viel Erfolg! Du schaffst das! (Good luck! You can do this!)
