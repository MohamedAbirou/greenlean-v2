CALCULATED NUTRITION TARGETS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Daily Calories: {daily_calories} kcal
- Protein: {protein}g ({protein_pct_of_calories}% of calories)
- Carbohydrates: {carbs}g ({carbs_pct_of_calories}% of calories)
- Fats: {fats}g ({fat_pct_of_calories}% of calories)

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
1. **Health-Condition-Based Adjustments** (If Applicable):
   - Tailor the plan based on any reported health conditions (e.g., IBS, lactose intolerance, diabetes, hypertension, gluten sensitivity, etc.).
   - Avoid or minimize foods that may worsen the user's specific condition(s).
   - Suggest safe and suitable alternatives where possible (e.g., lactose-free dairy for lactose intolerance, gluten-free grains for celiac sensitivity).
   - If a condition requires special nutrition (e.g., high fiber for cholesterol, low sodium for hypertension), adjust meal composition accordingly.
   - Always prioritize balance, comfort, and tolerability for the individual user.

2. **Cuisine & Cultural Adaptation**:
   - Adapt recipes to local ingredient availability in {country}
   - Respect cultural food preferences and cooking methods

3. **Budget & Time Optimization**:
   - Keep recipes within {grocery_budget} budget range
   - Ensure prep time aligns with {cooking_time} constraint
   - Suggest affordable alternatives for expensive ingredients
   - Include batch cooking tips when appropriate

4. **Goal-Specific Optimization**:
   - For "Lose fat": Create slight calorie deficit, high protein, high satiety
   - For "Build muscle": Ensure adequate protein timing, pre/post-workout nutrition
   - For "Body recomposition": Balance protein high, strategic carb timing
   - For "Maintain weight": Focus on nutrient density and sustainability

5. **Medication & Supplement Interactions**:
   - Consider timing with medications (e.g., probiotics with meals)
   - Avoid contraindicated foods if relevant
   - Support medication effectiveness through nutrition

6. **Consistency & Sustainability**:
   - Allow some meal repetition across days to support routine and consistency.
   - Favor practical, repeatable recipes over excessive novelty.
