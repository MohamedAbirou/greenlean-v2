**Workout Split & Environment Logic (MANDATORY)**:
  You must determine the optimal weekly training structure and exercise types based on:
   - Training Frequency: {exercise_frequency}
   - Training Environment: {training_environment}
   - Available Equipment: {equipment}
   - Main Goal: {main_goal}
   - Preferred Exercise Types: {preferred_exercise}

  The workout plan must ALWAYS include a logical training split and specific exercises per day.
  Each "workout" day must contain at least 4–8 exercises.

  PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES:
   - Apply progressive overload, adjust volume by recovery (sleep/stress/age).
   - Match rep ranges and intensity to goal (fat loss, muscle gain, strength, endurance).
   - Adapt to equipment, environment, and injury limitations.

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  🧩 SPLIT LOGIC BY FREQUENCY
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   • 1–2 days/week → Full Body each day (focus on compound, functional movements)
   • 3–4 days/week → Push/Pull or Upper/Lower Split
   • 5–6 days/week → Push/Pull/Legs or Upper/Lower/Conditioning
   • 7 days/week → Include at least 1–2 Active Recovery or Mobility days

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  🏋️ ENVIRONMENT LOGIC
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   **If training_environment includes "Gym":**
   - Use compound lifts + isolation work.
   - Leverage machines and free weights if “Full gym access” is available.
   - At least 5 exercises per day (2 compound, 2 isolation, 1 optional finisher).
   - Example: Push (Chest/Shoulders/Triceps), Pull (Back/Biceps), Legs (Quads/Hams/Glutes).

   **If training_environment includes "Home":**
   - Prioritize bodyweight + small equipment exercises.
   - Use resistance bands, dumbbells, or kettlebells if available.
   - Focus on circuits or supersets for time efficiency.
   - Example: Full Body Circuit, Lower Body Strength, Core + Mobility.

   **If training_environment includes "Outdoor":**
   - Include running, cycling, sprints, bodyweight circuits, and athletic drills.
   - Combine with calisthenics or endurance work.
   - Example: Interval Running, Hill Sprints, Outdoor HIIT, Sports Conditioning.

   **If multiple environments are selected:**
   - Alternate intelligently (e.g., Gym Mon/Wed/Fri, Home Tue/Thu, Outdoor Sat).

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  🎯 GOAL-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   **Weight Loss / Fat Loss / Mild Weight Loss / Extreme Weight Loss:**
   - Include 3–4 resistance sessions + 2 cardio/HIIT sessions.
   - Add calorie-burning finishers or circuits.
   - Ensure progressive overload with moderate weights.

   **Build Muscle / Body Recomposition:**
   - Use Push/Pull/Legs or Upper/Lower split depending on frequency.
   - Focus on progressive overload, hypertrophy rep ranges (8–12 reps).
   - Ensure balanced muscle coverage (chest/back/legs/arms/shoulders/core).

   **Improve Strength:**
   - Prioritize compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press, rows).
   - 3–5 sets of 3–6 reps, longer rest, controlled tempo.

   **Improve Endurance / General Health / Cardio-focused goals:**
   - Include running, cycling, swimming, or circuit training.
   - Moderate weights, higher reps, less rest.
   - At least 2 dedicated cardio/endurance sessions per week.

   **Improve Flexibility / Mobility / Stress Reduction:**
   - Include yoga, mobility flows, stretching sessions.
   - At least 3 mobility-based sessions (30–45 minutes each).

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ⚙️ EXERCISE STRUCTURE RULES
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Each workout day must follow this structure:
   - 1–2 Compound Exercises (e.g. Squat, Deadlift, Bench, Pull-up)
   - 2–3 Isolation / Accessory Exercises (target secondary muscles)
   - 1 Core or Finisher Exercise (HIIT, cardio burst, abs)
   - Provide sets, reps, rest, tempo, and clear safety/form cues.
   - If equipment is limited, suggest bodyweight or band alternatives.

   Always list 5–8 total exercises per session for Gym or Full Equipment users.
   Always list 4–6 exercises for Home/Outdoor workouts.
